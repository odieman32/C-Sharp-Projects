## 🎓 About This Repository

> **"These projects show my development and experience with programming through my schooling."**

Each project in this repository reflects different stages of my learning — from early assignments to more advanced application development. They demonstrate a wide variety of programming fundamentals, including:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Data structures and arrays
- User interfaces with Windows Forms
- File I/O and basic database interaction
- Modular code design and debugging techniques

---

## 💻 Development Environment

All of the projects in this repository were built using **Visual Studio**, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) that has been instrumental in helping me:

- Understand and apply programming concepts efficiently
- Build and debug Windows Forms applications
- Use built-in tools like IntelliSense and visual debuggers
- Organize and structure projects using professional standards

> **Visual Studio has played a key role in my development as a programmer**, giving me the tools and environment needed to write clean, maintainable, and efficient C# code.
